Basically I am going to write this while I do shit so that all the changes I'm doing make sense :D

Something I notice beforehand is you're using threading
This doesn't really do anything other than hurt performance because you could run the image stuff in the same thread
Due to the GIL (global interpreter lock) only one thread can actually use cpu resources at a time, meaning that it'd probably do you just as much good to run everything together

First of all, I'll make the main just a py file because I'm not used to working with jupyter notebooks

Second of all, I'm going to move everything to classes, that way I can make something that's extremely modular and allow people to just add modules easier

Starting with the interface, moving everything to a class and redoing slight bits of functions
ALSO, DXCAM!!!!! I love this library for getting images from screens because it's so fast and idk I love it an unreasonable amount
How much you wanna bet the "slowness" is because of ImageGrab instead of DXCam

Okay I've decided to instead write a testing file to test out different image grabbing libraries because I must know which one is the fastest
Okay, that was a bit of a waste of time, DXCam crushed as expected

Okay what is this rotation math
I'll try to fix

I tried to fix the rotation function, it isn't exact but I'll tweak it once I'm done with making everything else modular, because it will make it easier to test
Changing all the interface things to be more standardized, adding basic durations to all the functions so for things like punching you can just call it without a duration

High level operations sections I will deal with later, I am going to make everything extremely modular :DD

Going to write base classes, each sensor will have it's own class, and each 'strategy' as I've decided to call them will have it's own class
I now have to work on something that allows for decisions on what to do to be made a lot easier for the user

Okay, it took a while, and I got distracted by like 5 hours of modded minecraft with friends inbetween, I setup the main class and it should have all logic implemented already

All that's really left is to convert everything that already exists into the new system, but I think this is all I have time for today.
I have added a shit ton of comments on all the base classes, but this is still a work in progress so lmk if anything is confusing.
You don't have to accept this PR just yet, you can wait until I've completely redone everything to spec instead

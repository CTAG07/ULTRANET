this thingy is a fully automated agent to play ULTRAKILL.

here is a more cohesive explanation:

to run it, clone the repository and go to the run folder.

in there you will find main_behaviour.ipynb, this is the "central controller" script.

set ultrakill to the same settings as specified in the second(?) cell, then run the rest of the cells, fulscreen the game and hope for the best.

if anybody wants to improve this very temporary readme thank you :)
